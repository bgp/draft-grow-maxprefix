            <t>
                This document describes mechanisms to reduce the negative impact of certain types of misconfigurations or resource exhaustions in BGP-4 <xref target="RFC4271" /> operations.
                While <xref target="RFC4271" /> already described a method to tear down BGP-4 sessions when certain thresholds are exceeded, some nuances in this specification were missing resulting in inconsistencies between BGP-4 implementations.
                In addition to clarifying "inbound maximum prefix limits", this document also introduces a specification for "outbound maximum prefix limits".
            </t>

        <section title="Application of Control Theory to BGP-4 Operations">
            <t>
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Inbound Maximum Prefix Limits">
            <t>
                An operator can configure a BGP speaker to terminate its BGP session with a neighbor when the number of address prefixes received from that neighbor exceeds a locally configured upper limit.
                The BGP-4 speaker then MUST at a minimum be able to send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Threshold reached: Maximum Number of Prefixes Received", and optionally MAY support other actions.
                Reporting when thresholds have been exceeded is implementation specific but SHOULD include methods such as Syslog <xref target="RFC5424"/>.
                Inbound Maximum Prefix Limits can be applied in two distinct places in the conceptual model: before or after the application of routing policy.
            </t>
            <section title="Type A: Pre-Policy Inbound Maximum Prefix Limits">
                <t>
                    Adj-RIB-In stores routing information learned from inbound UPDATE messages that were received from another BGP speaker <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>.
                    The Type A pre-policy limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) as input into its threshold comparisons.
                    As example, when an operator configures the Type A pre-policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the other BGP speaker announces its 51th IPv4 Unicast NLRI, the session MUST be terminated.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Type A pre-policy limits are particularly useful to help dampen the effects of full table route leaks and memory exhaustion when the implementation stores rejected routes.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Type B: Post-Policy Inbound Maximum Prefix Limits">
                <t>
                    RFC4271 describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) that contains local policies that can be applied to the information in the Routing Information Base (RIB).
                    The Type B post-policy limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), after application of the Import Policy as input into its threshold comparisons.
                    As an example, when an operator configures the Type B post-policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the other BGP speaker announces a hundred IPv4 Unicast routes of which none are accepted due to local policy (and thus not considered for the Loc-RIB by the local BGP speaker), the session is not terminated.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Type B post-policy limits are useful to help prevent FIB exhaustion.
                </t>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section title="Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits">
            <t>
                The Adj-RIBs-Out stores information the local BGP speaker selected for advertisement to its neighbors.
                The routing information stored in the Adj-RIBs-Out will be carried in the local BGP speaker's UPDATE messages and advertised to its neighbors <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>.
                The Outbound Maximum Prefix Limit uses the number NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), after application of the Export Policy as input into its threshold comparisons.
                By definition, Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits are Post-Policy.
            </t>
            <t>
                When an operator configures the Outbound Maximum Prefix Limit to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and for one reason or another the BGP speaker would advertise more than 50 routes, the BGP session MUST at a minimum be able to terminate the session and send the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Threshold reached: Maximum Number of Prefixes Sent", and MAY offer other actions such as appending to Syslog.
            </t>
            <t>
                Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits are useful to help dampen the negative effects of a misconfiguration in local policy.
                In some cases it may be more desirable to tear down a BGP session rather than participate in a route leak.

                This section records the status of known implementations of the
                protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
                this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
                RFC7942. The description of implementations in this
                section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
                progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
                individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
                IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
                information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
                This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
                of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised
                to note that other implementations may exist.
