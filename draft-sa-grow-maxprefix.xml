                This document describes mechanisms to reduce the negative impact of certain types of misconfigurations or resource exhaustions in BGP-4 <xref target="RFC4271" /> operations.
                While <xref target="RFC4271" /> already described a method to tear down BGP-4 sessions when certain thresholds are exceeded, some nuances in this specification were missing resulting in inconsistencies between BGP-4 implementations.
                In addition to clarifying "inbound maximum prefix limits", this document also introduces a specification for "outbound maximum prefix limits".

            <t>
                An operator can configure a BGP speaker to terminate its BGP session with a neighbor when the number of address prefixes received from that neighbor exceeds a locally configured upper limit.
                The BGP-4 speaker then MUST send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Threshold reached: Maximum Number of Prefixes Received".
                Inbound Maximum Prefix Limits can be applied in two distinct places in the conceptual model: before or after the application of routing policy.
                Reporting when thresholds have been exceeded is implementation specific but SHOULD include methods such as Syslog <xref target="RFC5424"/>.
            </t>
            <section title="Type A: pre-policy limit">
                <t>
                    Adj-RIB-In stores routing information learned from inbound UPDATE messages that were received from another BGP speaker <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>.
                    The Type A pre-policy limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifer (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) as input into its threshold comparisons.
                    As example, when an operator configures the Type A pre-policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the other BGP speaker announces its 51th IPv4 Unicast NLRI, the session MUST be torn down.

            <t>
                This section records the status of known implementations of the
                protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
                this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
                RFC7942. The description of implementations in this
                section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
                progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
                individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
                IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
                information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
                This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
                of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised
                to note that other implementations may exist.

                As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of inbound or outbound maximum prefix limits:

                    <t>Cisco IOS XR, inbound post-policy</t>
                    <t>Nokia SR OS, inbound pre-policy or inbound post-policy, but not both at the same time</t>

                make it clear who does what:
                if A sends too many prefixes to B
                A should see "ABC" in log
                B should see "DEF" in log
                to make it clear which of the two parties does what

                2)
