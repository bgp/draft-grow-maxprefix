1.  Introduction

   This document describes mechanisms to reduce the negative impact of
   certain types of misconfigurations and/or resource exhaustions in BGP
   [RFC4271] operations.  While [RFC4271] already described a method to
   tear down BGP sessions when certain thresholds are exceeded, some
   nuances in this specification were missing resulting in
   inconsistencies between BGP implementations.  This document
   introduces a specification for "outbound maximum prefix limits".

2.  Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits

   An operator MAY configure a BGP speaker to terminate its BGP session
   with a neighbor when the number of address prefixes to be advertised
   to that neighbor exceeds a locally configured post-policy upper
   limit.  The BGP speaker then MUST send the neighbor a NOTIFICATION
   message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Threshold
   reached: Maximum Number of Prefixes Send".  Implementations MAY
   support additional actions.  The Hard Cease action is defined in
   [RFC8538].  Reporting when thresholds have been exceeded is an
   implementation specific consideration, but SHOULD include methods

   such as Syslog [RFC5424].  By definition, Outbound Maximum Prefix
   Limits are Post-Policy.

   The Adj-RIBs-Out stores information selected by the local BGP speaker
   for advertisement to its neighbors.  The routing information stored
   in the Adj-RIBs-Out will be carried in the local BGP speaker's UPDATE
   messages and advertised to its neighbors Section 3.2 [RFC4271].  The
   Outbound Maximum Prefix Limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address
   Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier
   (SAFI), after application of the Export Policy, as input into its
   threshold comparisons.  For example, when an operator configures the
   Outbound Maximum Prefix Limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given
   EBGP session, and were about to announce its 51st IPv4 Unicast NLRI
   to the other BGP speaker as a result of the local export policy, the
   session MUST be terminated.

   Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits are useful to help dampen the negative
   effects of a misconfiguration in local policy.  In many cases, it
   would be more desirable to tear down a BGP session rather than
   causing or propagating a route leak.

3.  Considerations for Operations with Multi-Protocol BGP

4.  Considerations for soft thresholds

   describe soft and hard limits (warning vs teardown)

5.  Security Considerations

   Maximum Prefix Limits are an essential tool for routing operations
   and SHOULD be used to increase stability.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA updates the name of subcode "Maximum
   Number of Prefixes Reached" to "Threshold exceeded: Maximum Number of
   Prefixes Received" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION message subcodes"
   registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group.

   This memo requests that IANA assigns a new subcode named "Threshold
   exceeded: Maximum Number of Prefixes Send" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION
   message subcodes" registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" group.

8.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC7942.  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   The below table provides an overview (as of the moment of writing) of
   which vendors have produced implementation of inbound or outbound
   maximum prefix limits.  Each table cell shows the applicable
   configuration keywords if the vendor implemented the feature.

   1) make it clear who does what: if A sends too many prefixes to B A
   should see "ABC" in log B should see "DEF" in log to make it clear
   which of the two parties does what 2) recommended by default
   automatically restart after between 15 and 30 minutes
